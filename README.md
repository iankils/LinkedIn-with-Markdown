# LinkedIn-with-Markdown
Partner up with a classmate. Interview them to collect data that could be used to create a LinkedIn page. Be creative and have fun with it. We all have different stories to tell and different levels of experience.
The expectation is a professional looking LinkedIn page.
You are to only use Markdown.

For now you are going to just save your work in VSC.
(*The next phase of this assignment will be to put it in GitHub)

**For now you will not submit anything [until we get your personalized IDEs up and running.**

I will be looking at creativity, professionalism, variety of Markdown used, etc.
